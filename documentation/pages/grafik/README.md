# desktop products
here we want to put the desktop documentation in

# guidelines
* languages
    * for each language we need a file example.de.mdx; examlpe.it.mdx...
* mdx files    
	* https://mdxjs.com/
	* in the documentation we need special filters therefore we use mdx files instead of raw md files. 
	* custom syntax
	* in mdx files we can also use filters for products or 
		* ``<geodesigner><geodesigner>``
	* or we want to show a section as info or warning
		* ``<info></info>``
		* ``<warning></warning>``
